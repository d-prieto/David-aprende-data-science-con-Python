# David aprende data science con Python

Hi there, I'm David Prieto and I'm doing a Data Science course with Barcelona activa. 

I run with Python 3 an I'm usin Anaconda an Jupyter. 

< 3


### Things I learnt about jupyther and github

-  By default the notebooks in windows are stored in the user folder. So you may want to save them elsewhere
-  You can change the directory of a file uploaded to github by changing the name. For example "test1.ipynb" to "first tests/test1.ipynb" creates the folder "first tests" and drops there the file. 
-  You cannot change that easily the path of a file you can't edit the raw with github (for example the .pdf)

## Pandas 

Panda means "panel data" but I think of the Panda bear. It's kind of a datasheet reader and processer.
